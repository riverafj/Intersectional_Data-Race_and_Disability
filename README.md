# Intersectional_Data-Race_and_Disability

# How it works
By clicking or copying the hyperlink, it shows a tableau table of which I created a bar, line, and bubble graph.
Dashboard 1 will show the bar and line graphs, while Dashboard 2 will show the bubble graph.
What is shown on the bar graph are, "Ethnicities with disabilities and Total Ethnicities" by age in the United States.
I created a line graph to show a more clear picture of the bigger picture.
The two bubble grpahs show and are represented by color, are Pink for Female and Blue for Male. One shows males and 
females with disability and the other shows total males and females in the united states.
If you hover your mouse over each category, you will notice the actual number of disabilities in each. Weather its by
race, age, or make or female. 

# Closure
Creating a more visual dataset for the audience, I didnt realize that people with disability and the total are almost identical
in numbers and by just looking at the bubble graph, there are more females with disabilities than males. There are also more 
females in the United States than males. I will also post images here but you are not able to see the exact numbers when 
you hover the image.
