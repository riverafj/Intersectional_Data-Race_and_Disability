# How I created this visual
I did some research online and realized what I was reading had a downloadble dataset. I downloaded the dataset and ofcourse
it was not organized. So I used excel to orginize and clean the dataset. I had to rearrange some columns and deleted the null values
which it didn't affect what I was trying to do. I then used a visualizing tool called Tableau. I like using tableau because it
is easier to represent a more orginized and clear picture for the audience. After going back and forth with excel and tableau, I was
finally ready to make the sheets and dashboards. I used my skills to identify which values go into either the column or the row. Lastly,
I published my work and saved it. 


# How it works
By clicking or copying the hyperlink, it shows a tableau table of which I created a bar, line, and bubble graph.
Dashboard 1 will show the bar and line graphs, while Dashboard 2 will show the bubble graph.
What is shown on the bar graph are, "Ethnicities with disabilities and Total Ethnicities" by age in the United States.
I created a line graph to show a more clear picture of the bigger picture.
The two bubble grpahs show and are represented by color, are Pink for Female and Blue for Male. One shows males and 
females with disability and the other shows total males and females in the united states.
If you hover your mouse over each category, you will notice the actual number of disabilities in each. Weather its by
race, age, or make or female. 

# Using Python
I also used python to analyze more into the data. There will be images that show a list of the ethnicities with disabilities and
a list of the total ethnicity population. Also shown, is the list of males and females with disabilities and total males and females
all together. You can clearly see that there are more females in total and with disabilities.

# Closure
Creating a more visual dataset for the audience, I didnt realize that people with disability and the total are almost identical
in numbers and by just looking at the bubble graph, there are more females with disabilities than males. There are also more 
females in the United States than males. I will also post images here but you are not able to see the exact numbers when 
you hover the image.
